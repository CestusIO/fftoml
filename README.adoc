= fftoml

toml implementation for ff and ffcli. 
allows skipping table levels to better compose config files for cli applications

It is based on 

But adds:

WithTableSkip is an option which configures a value which will be skipped in keynames.
For example, given the following TOML
[code, toml]
----
    [section.subsection]
    value = 10
----
Parse will match to a flag with the name `-section.subsection.value` by default.
if the tableskip is `section`. Parse will match to a flag `-subsection.value` instead
